# Project Report
## System Design
BrokerBot has two components: a cloud service and a bot player. Those who are familiar with the game [Stocks & Bonds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1590/stocks-bonds) know that during the game, one of the players needs to take charge of updating the prices on the chalkboard visible to the game players. While this may have been all well and good for 1964, the cloud component of BrokerBot is designed to handle this instead. Go to the URL of your AWS site and you'll see a virtual, color-annotated version of the game's chalkboard, which shows the game's stock prices each year.

The actual BrokerBot game player is meant to add another competitor to the game -- the more the merrier! BrokerBot requires someone to update the game prices (which it then pushes to the cloud) using the encoder dial as an interface. The code is designed to (hopefully) be modular and easy for someone to modify the strategy that BrokerBot uses. By default, it uses a very simple "buy low, sell high" strategy under which it sells stocks after they reach a certain threshold and spends all available money on the cheapest stock. This should be a reasonably competitive strategy in a normal game.

## Project Progression
BrokerBot evolved from an initial two-board setup to a single board setup for simplicity. This is only because the RobotDyn D1-R1 board I have has a very limited number of wire pins -- a better board would be able to do more. Additionally, due to my limited tool availability, I wasn't able to add a keypad for input as I had originally planned. However, I think the encoder dial actually works quite well for this purpose. The only drawback right now is that the encoder doesn't take into account rotation direction, but this is again only because the board doesn't have enough pins for the "direction" wire on the encoder. Overall, I accomplished the main functionality I wanted to. See the [README](../README.md)'s "Not Yet Implemented" section for features I'd like to add that I think would be cool.
